 a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing 
 an Internet-based hypertext system.[6] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software
 in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, 
but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.
 In his personal notes[7] from 1990 he listed[8] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"

 which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF
 command developed in the early
